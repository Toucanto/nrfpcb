A PCB for the XIAO nRF52840 and Wio-SX1262

# KiCad files are **NOT** availible for version 1

Version 1 & 2 do not have a bottom soldermask, it is an empty layer. This will be fixed in v3. PCBWay afaik can fix this issue themselves, as they did it when i ordered it on their site. As it stands though without the soldermask, it is unmanufacturable.
