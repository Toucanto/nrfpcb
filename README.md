A PCB for the XIAO nRF52840 and Wio-SX1262

# KiCad files are **NOT** availible for version 1

Version 1 & 2 are meant to be printed in **2 LAYERS** even though it seems like 1. 

Version 1 is not reccomended to use, it is the same as V2 but with removed solder pads. I had to remove those as PCBWay treated them as via's...

Version 3 has the [L76K XIAO GNSS Module slot](https://www.seeedstudio.com/L76K-GNSS-Module-for-Seeed-Studio-XIAO-p-5864.html).
