A PCB for the XIAO nRF52840 and Wio-SX1262

# KiCad files are **NOT** availible for version 1

Version 1 & 2 are meant to be printed in **2 LAYERS** even though it seems like 1. 
Version 2 XIAO boards **MUST** be in the orientation shown in the image!
The easiest way to get the sx1262 board onto the V2 is to solder the pins of the sx1262 to the pads on the V2.

Version 1 is not reccomended to use, it is the same as V2 but with removed solder pads. I had to remove those as PCBWay treated them as via's...

Version 3 has the [L76K XIAO GNSS Module slot](https://www.seeedstudio.com/L76K-GNSS-Module-for-Seeed-Studio-XIAO-p-5864.html). **THIS IS COMING IN THE FUTURE!**
